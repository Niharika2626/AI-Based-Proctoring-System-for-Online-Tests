From the past year, Online Examination has become most popular in all the 
educational fields due to covid-19 However, the institutions are facing a big 
difficulty in terms of proctoring methods. If the way we are living is to be the 
new normal then there is a need to find some solution. In this project, we have 
proposed a solution that to develop an AI-based integrated system that can helps 
to preventing cheating in examinations and we present some techniques and tools 
through which the proctor need not to be present throughout the exam. Our AI based model will be able to detect any unfair in an examination.
